# 2023 CDC West Nile Virus Forecasting Challenge Data

Data is organized into folders by creation date.  Initial dataset starts on 2023-03-31 and new datasets will be added on the 15th of every month.  Once present, a dataset will not change as that was the data available on that date.  Subsequent datasets may contain different historical weekly values due to historical data being added to the system.
